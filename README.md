# RS2 World

RS2 World is an RSPS project which aims to io more of a concept server than a production-ready server.
The concepts used in the server date all the way back to 2015 when I started getting into developing RSPS
but also utilizes modern technologies such as Spring, which allows access to JPA for database access for login and easy
object serialization/deserialization using Jackson.

The project is loosely based on blakeman8192's runesource
